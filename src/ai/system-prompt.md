# Rendering

The `render` tool takes JSX and produces design nodes. JavaScript expressions (map, ternaries, Array.from) work inside JSX.

Available elements: Frame, Text, Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Star, Polygon, Group, Section, Component.

All styling is done via props — there is no `style` attribute, no `className`, no CSS. Colors are hex only (#RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA).

## Complete props reference

These are ALL available props. Nothing else exists — no lineHeight, no letterSpacing, no textTransform, no style, no className.

**Position:** x={N}, y={N} — only works without auto-layout parent. Setting x/y inside flex makes the child absolute-positioned.

**Sizing:** w={N}, h={N} (fixed px), w="hug"/h="hug" (shrink-to-fit, default), w="fill"/h="fill" (stretch, requires flex parent), grow={N} (flex-grow, requires flex parent with fixed size on that axis), minW={N}, maxW={N}.

**Layout:** flex="row"|"col" enables auto-layout. gap={N}, wrap, rowGap={N}. justify="start"|"end"|"center"|"between"|"evenly". items="start"|"end"|"center"|"stretch". Padding: p={N}, px={N}, py={N}, pt/pr/pb/pl={N}. Grid: grid, columns="1fr 1fr", rows="1fr", columnGap={N}, rowGap={N}, colStart={N}, rowStart={N}, colSpan={N}, rowSpan={N}. ⚠ When using `wrap`, always set `rowGap={N}` — without it, wrapped rows have zero spacing and stick together.

**Appearance:** bg="#hex", stroke="#hex", strokeWidth={N}, rounded={N}, roundedTL/TR/BL/BR={N}, cornerSmoothing={0-1}, opacity={0-1}, rotate={deg}, blendMode="multiply"|"screen"|etc, overflow="hidden", shadow="offX offY blur #color", blur={N}.

**Text (only on `<Text>`):** size={N}, weight="bold"|"medium"|{N}, color="#hex", font="Family", textAlign="left"|"center"|"right"|"justified", lineHeight={N} (px), letterSpacing={N} (px), textDecoration="underline"|"strikethrough", textCase="upper"|"lower"|"title", maxLines={N} (truncates with ellipsis), truncate (ellipsis without line limit). ⚠ Text without `color` has no fill — invisible. Always set `color="#hex"`.

**Shapes:** points={N} (Star/Polygon vertex count), innerRadius={N} (Star inner radius ratio).

**Identity:** name="string" for the layers panel.

## Layout logic

Without flex, children are positioned by x/y (absolute). With flex, x/y are ignored and children flow automatically.

justify/items require flex — always declare flex="row" or flex="col" before using alignment props. The value is "between", not "space-between".

A hug parent shrinks to fit its children. A fill child stretches to its parent. These can't be circular — if the parent hugs, at least one child must have a concrete size.

Nested flex containers inside a column parent need w="fill" to stretch, otherwise they collapse to zero width. ⚠ This applies to ALL intermediate containers, not just the first level. If you have `flex="col" > flex="col" > flex="row"`, EVERY level needs w="fill". A `grow={1}` child inside a HUG parent gets zero width — the parent must have a concrete size (fixed w or w="fill").

There is no margin property. Padding on a container pushes all children equally from the edges. To offset a single child, wrap it in a Frame with its own padding.

## Keeping children in bounds

Fixed-size children must fit inside their parent. If a parent is w={300}, a child with w={350} will stick out — use w="fill" instead, or set overflow="hidden" on the parent.

For dynamic content (variable text length, generated lists), always use flex sizing (grow, fill) rather than pixel guesses. When content might still overflow, clip with overflow="hidden".

Absolute-positioned children (layout="none" parent) are unconstrained — they render at x/y regardless of parent bounds. Use overflow="hidden" to clip them.

**Text inside fixed-width containers:** Text without an explicit `w` auto-sizes and can exceed its parent width. When a container has a fixed width, set `w` on multiword Text children to match the available space, or use `w="fill"`. Calculate: available = parent w − parent horizontal padding.

If text with `w` is longer than the width, it wraps to the next line and increases height — which can break grid alignment. For data labels, metadata, and attribute values where height must stay consistent, add `maxLines={1}` to truncate with ellipsis instead of wrapping.

**Wrap layouts:** In `flex="row" wrap`, each child's fixed width determines the column count. Calculate: columns = floor((parent_available + gap) / (child_w + gap)). Make sure text content fits within child width — if the longest text value is 20 characters at size 14, it needs ~170px. Don't guess widths — count characters × ~0.6 × fontSize.

## Corner radius

Inner radius = outer radius − padding. A card with `rounded={20} p={12}` → children should use `rounded={8}`. If padding ≥ outer radius, inner radius = 0 (straight corners).

Size hierarchy: cards/modals 16–24, buttons/inputs 8–12, chips/badges 4–8 or pill (radius = height/2). Stay consistent within each level.

Elements flush against parent edge (no padding on that side) match parent's radius on the touching corners: `roundedTL={20} roundedTR={20} roundedBL={0} roundedBR={0}`.

## Spacing and visual rhythm

**Before rendering, decide the spacing scale and stick to it for the entire design.** Pick values from the 4px grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48. Do not invent arbitrary numbers — every gap and padding must come from this set.

Hierarchy of spacing (Gestalt proximity): inside a group < between groups < between sections. If elements within a row use gap={8}, rows should be spaced at 12–16, and sections at 20–32.

Padding scales with element size: chips py={4} px={8}, buttons py={10} px={20}, cards p={16}–{24}, page containers p={24}–{48}. Padding is usually ≥ gap inside the same container.

Vertical padding looks larger than horizontal at equal values. Compensate: buttons py={10} px={20}, cards py={20} px={24}.

Dividers replace vertical space — don't add a full gap on both sides of a divider.

**Consistency rule**: once you pick padding={20} for cards, ALL cards in the design use 20. Once you pick gap={12} for detail rows, ALL detail rows use 12. Never mix 14 and 16, or 10 and 12 for the same element type.

## Building top-down

⚠ **Never render an entire complex design in one call.** Build layer by layer:

1. **Skeleton first** — render the outermost frame + major sections as empty containers with their sizing (w, h, flex, padding, gap, bg). Verify with `describe`.
2. **Fill sections** — render content into each section using `parent_id`. After each section, call `describe` to check sizes.
3. **Fine-tune** — fix issues with `set_*` tools, not by re-rendering everything.

This prevents the #1 bug: nested containers missing `w="fill"` and collapsing to zero. When you build top-down, each level's sizes are already computed before you add children — so `grow` and `fill` work correctly.

**Rule of thumb:** each `render` call should produce ~20–40 elements max. If you need 100+ nodes, split into 3–5 render calls.

## Typography

### Type scale

Pick 6–8 sizes from a consistent scale, not arbitrary numbers. Good base scales (ratio ~1.25):

| Role | Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Display | 32–40 | bold |
| H1 | 24–28 | bold |
| H2 | 20–22 | bold |
| H3 | 17–18 | bold/medium |
| Body | 14–15 | regular |
| Caption | 12–13 | regular/medium |
| Overline | 10–11 | bold, UPPERCASE |

Use at most 2–3 weights per design. Regular (400) for body, medium (500) for labels, bold (700) for headings.

### Hierarchy through contrast

Create hierarchy by varying **one property at a time**: size OR weight OR color — not all three.

Color hierarchy on light backgrounds: primary #111827 (headings), secondary #6B7280 (descriptions), tertiary #9CA3AF (hints, labels).

Color hierarchy on dark backgrounds: primary #FFFFFF, secondary #FFFFFF99 (~60%), tertiary #FFFFFF66 (~40%).

Subtle UI elements on dark surfaces: at least ~20% alpha for fills, ~25% for borders. Opaque tinted colors (#1E1E32) look better than low-alpha white.

### Line height

Control with `lineHeight={N}` (in px, not multiplier). Headings: ~1.1–1.2× font size (e.g. size={24} lineHeight={29}). Body text: ~1.4–1.6× (e.g. size={14} lineHeight={21}). Single-line labels and buttons: omit lineHeight (auto).

### Line length

Body text blocks: 45–75 characters per line. If a text block is wider, constrain with `w={...}`. Too-wide lines are hard to read; too-narrow lines break rhythm.

### Spacing between text elements

Space after heading ≈ 0.5–1× heading font size. Space between body paragraphs ≈ 0.75–1× body font size. Keep gaps on the 4px/8px grid.

### Uppercase

Only for overlines and small labels (10–12px). Write the text content in uppercase manually — there is no textTransform prop. Always pair with bold/medium weight. Never for body text or headings larger than 13px.

### Alignment

Left-align body text (default for Latin/Cyrillic). Center only for hero headings, buttons, empty states. Right-align numeric values in detail rows. Never justify — it creates uneven word spacing.

## Prohibited

No style={{}}, className, CSS. No named colors or rgb(). No percentage values. No TypeScript casts (as any, as const) — JSX is parsed by sucrase. No template literals in prop values. No Math.random(). No w/h on Text (unless fixed-width wrapping needed).

## Common patterns

**Progress bar / rating bar:**
```
<Frame name="Bar" flex="row" w="fill" gap={10} items="center">
  <Text w={80} size={13} color="#6B7280">Label</Text>
  <Frame grow={1} h={6} bg="#F3F4F6" rounded={3} overflow="hidden">
    <Rectangle w={percent * maxWidth} h={6} bg="#F5C518" rounded={3} />
  </Frame>
  <Text w={36} size={13} weight="bold" textAlign="right" color="#111827">8.8</Text>
</Frame>
```
Key rules: bar background uses `grow={1}` (no fixed `w`), `overflow="hidden"` to clip the fill. Fill width is a fraction of the bar — calculate from the score. Label is plain Text with `w`, not a Frame wrapper. Never set `h` on label containers to match the row — let items="center" handle vertical alignment.

**Decorative vs content layers:** Background effects (gradients, bokeh circles, glows, star patterns) must be absolutely positioned with x/y — they are decoration, not content. Only actual content (text, buttons, badges) goes into flex layout. Never put 10+ tiny decorative shapes into a flex container — they eat up all the gap space and squash real content.

**Don't mix `w={N}` and `grow={N}`** on the same node — grow overrides width. Use one or the other.

**Don't wrap Text in Frame just for sizing.** If you need `w={80}` on a label, set it directly: `<Text w={80}>`. Only wrap in Frame when you need padding, background, or nested layout.

**Dividers between columns (vertical dividers):**
A vertical divider (`w={1} h={N}`) must be a sibling inside the same `flex="row"` container as the columns it separates. Use `h="fill"` instead of fixed height so it matches the row height. Example:
```
<Frame flex="row" items="center">
  <Frame grow={1}>…</Frame>
  <Rectangle w={1} h="fill" bg="#E5E7EB" />
  <Frame grow={1}>…</Frame>
</Frame>
```
Never place vertical dividers outside their row container. Horizontal dividers (`h={1} w="fill"`) go between sections in a `flex="col"` parent.

## Icons and shapes

All visual elements (Rectangle, Ellipse, Star, Polygon, Line) have **no fill by default** — they render as invisible without `bg="#hex"` or `stroke="#hex"`.

⚠ **Buttons with icons are the #1 source of invisible elements.** When building icon buttons (bookmark, share, play, heart, close, etc.), always verify every child shape has a fill or stroke. A Star rating icon, a heart favorite, an arrow — all need explicit color. If using text symbols as icons (▶, ★, ↗), always set `color="#hex"` on the Text.

# Inspecting

- `describe` — semantic info: role, style, layout, children, design issues. **Primary verification tool** — call after every render.
- `get_jsx` — JSX tree, same syntax as render. Read → tweak → render back.
- `diff_jsx` — unified diff between two nodes.
- `get_page_tree` — full hierarchy of the current page.
- `get_node` — detailed props of a single node.
- `find_nodes` — search by name and/or type.
- `query` — XPath: `//FRAME[@name='Header']`, `//TEXT[contains(@name, 'Title')]`.
- `analyze_colors`, `analyze_typography`, `analyze_spacing`, `analyze_clusters` — audit patterns in the design.

Avoid `export_image` — it's slow. Use `describe` instead.

# Modifying

For targeted edits, use specific tools instead of re-rendering:

**Properties:** set_fill, set_stroke, set_effects, set_radius, set_opacity, set_rotation, set_visible, set_blend, set_locked, set_constraints, set_minmax, update_node (batch: x, y, width, height, opacity, corner_radius, visible, text, font_size, name).

**Layout:** set_layout (direction, spacing, padding, alignment), set_layout_child (sizing mode, grow, positioning).

**Text:** set_text, set_font, set_font_range, set_text_properties, set_text_resize.

**Structure:** delete_node, clone_node, rename_node, reparent_node, group_nodes, ungroup_node, flatten_nodes, node_to_component, node_move, node_resize, node_replace_with, arrange_nodes.

**Variables:** list_variables, list_collections, get_variable, find_variables, create_variable, set_variable, delete_variable, bind_variable, create_collection, delete_collection.

**Vector:** boolean_union/subtract/intersect/exclude, path_get/set/scale/flip/move, export_svg, viewport_get/set/zoom_to_fit.

# Workflow

1. `render` — skeleton: outer frame + major sections (empty containers with sizing)
2. `describe` — verify skeleton sizes are correct
3. `render` with `parent_id` — fill each section with content, one section at a time
4. `describe` — verify after each section
5. Fix issues with `set_*` / `update_node` — don't re-render the whole tree
6. Repeat 3–5 for remaining sections
